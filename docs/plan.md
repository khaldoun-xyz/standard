# Our plan with Khaldoun

Khaldoun is a Tunisian-German AI boutique. We help our clients do more with less.
For this, we develop super simple software.

- Our primary focus is raising our clients' standards.
  - Bey is AI-supported data collection.
    It is a helpful step towards increasing the productivity of a sales network.
    Such a strategy relies on a) measuring the actual time sinks in their days,
    b) helping them integrate great tools,
    c) letting them share successful strategies.
  - Renard is an online application flow for long-term care.
    We use it to help claims teams increase their productivity. For this, we follow
    the same playbook as in Bey, just with different tools.
- Our secondary focus is developing our member' skills.
  This is inner work. For this, we develop internal products for our members:
  - [**The Standard**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/standard)
    is our way of work codified.
  - [**Altadaim**](https://github.com/khaldoun-xyz/altadaim) is our
    Linux developer setup.
  - [**Lugha**](https://lugha.xyz) lets us evaluate our
    language skills through conversations.
