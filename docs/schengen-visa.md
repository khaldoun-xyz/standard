# Important Considerations

1. **Financial Means**

   * Proof of sufficient funds is mandatory, usually at least €60 per day.
   * The “Allocation Touristique” is the most common supporting evidence.

2. **Document Consistency**

   * All information must be accurate and consistent across documents.
   * Any false or inconsistent information may lead to refusal and affect future visa applications.

3. **Processing Time**

   * Applications should be submitted at least 8 weeks before the planned travel date, as processing can take several weeks.
